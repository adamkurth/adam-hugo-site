I'm always excited to connect with fellow researchers, collaborators, and anyone interested in the intersection of statistics, public health, and epidemiology. Whether you're looking to discuss potential collaborations, share insights about ongoing projects, or explore opportunities in health informatics and patient advocacy, I'd love to hear from you!

Don't hesitate – I believe the best ideas often emerge from meaningful conversations and diverse perspectives.
