Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at Brown University, with a research focus on Bayesian nonparametrics and causal inference. I aim to develop methods for understanding highly heterogeneous patient outcomes in complex clinical domains such as transplantation and cancer. My work is driven by methodological problems in treatment effect heterogeneity, confounding, and risk stratification, with the ultimate goal of supporting personalized clinical decision-making and advancing health equity.

Before Brown, I completed an Accelerated M.S. in Statistics at Arizona State University. My thesis developed an adaptation of the CART algorithm using a Dirichlet-Multinomial objective (DM-CART) to investigate birth weight determinants for risk-based subgrouping in perinatal health.

I also hold a B.S. in Mathematics (Statistics) from ASU, where I graduated *summa cum laude* with a minor in Philosophy. During my time at ASU, I worked at the Biodesign Institute and the CXLS/CXFEL facility, contributing to biophysics research building data analysis tools and customized photon-detector systems for X-ray free electron lasers.
