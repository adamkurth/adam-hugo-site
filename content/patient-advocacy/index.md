### COTA for Adam K Campaign
Since 2020, I’ve partnered with the [Children’s Organ Transplant Association (COTA)](https://cota.org/cotaforadamk/), a nonprofit that supports transplant patients and their families through community-driven fundraising campaigns. With the help of friends and family, we launched **COTA for Adam K**, a campaign that continues to support my long-term medical needs following transplantation.

### Highlights

- **COTA for Adam K**  
  Active since 2020, this campaign has helped raise ongoing support for post-transplant care while also promoting awareness about organ donation and equitable access to treatment.

- **2022 COTA Calendar Feature**  
  I was featured in COTA’s national calendar, where I shared my personal transplant story as part of their effort to raise community awareness and engagement.

- **The Mulligan Golf Tournament** *(May 2022)*  
  I helped organize a local golf fundraiser that brought together community supporters and raised funds in support of COTA’s mission.
